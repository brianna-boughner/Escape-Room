# Escape-Room

Hello! This is a game created in Unity 3D using C# - it's a couple years old so I've learned a lot since creating it, but it's one of my favourite projects.

The game can be run using the executable file I attached, and all the scripts I wrote are in a folder. The point of the game is to figure out the puzzles and get to the next room :)
